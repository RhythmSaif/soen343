Updates to complete as of november 8th:
All are fairly minor changes.

1: Use case models need to be updated (names do not match with other files).
2: There are missing state diagrams for critical use cases (modify & view bookings).
3: The class diagram should have a relation between console and roomCatalog (as hinted by cc).
4: In SSD_UC8, the function modifyReservation is missing it's parenthesis at the end(should be modifyReservation()).
5: We are missing some system contracts (I think).
